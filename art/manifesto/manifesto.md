**NOSIE IN MY HEAD**

My art intends to **crack the ice on stagnant ponds**:
>To force eyes open beneath the surfaces we’ve agreed not to disturb

---

### I. ON CONFRONTATION
Art isn’t my rebellion – it’s the **pus** leaking through society’s bandaid of _“normal”_

I want to frame the absurdities we have all learned to swallow: the cruelty we deem “necessary,”
Not the things we *can’t* change, the things we *choose not to*

I want to spotlight the lies we chew and swallow like daily vitamins, the cruelty we call “business”, the systems we fuck like dead-end relationships because the loneliness of freedom terrifies us

A spotlight on the **self-serving rot** in all of us. Not to shame, but to unravel: *Look how easy it is to be the villain in someone else’s story. Look how casually we judge what we refuse to see in ourselves*

### II. ON THE UNSPOKEN
Words get pickled in debate, diluted by disclaimers, so I will scream into the void and call it art

_Yes, you’ve felt this too. No, it’s not normal, No, our guilt doesn’t make us innocent_

---

### III. ON SELF-IMMOLATION
I want to dig into my own hated places: _Here’s the noise that almost killed me._
To pin these wet specimens under bright lights, the hypocrisies I’ve sugarcoated as “growth”, the bigotries I have giftwrapped as "generational trauma", the suicide note I revised into a TED Talk

This is **forced accountability**: If I must choke on my own bile, you’ll smell it on my breath. This isn’t a confession. It’s the **mold** growing where we trapped accountability in glass jars

---

### IV. ON WHAT MY ART IS FOR
To make the invisible *inescapable*
To turn “that’s just how it is” into “why the fuck is it like this?”
To autopsy self-destruction and find everyone’s fingerprints on the blade
To replace *thoughts and prayers* with **itch and sweat**

>_You’ve felt this. I’ve ignored this. We’re both here_

My art is not a solution. It’s a crowbar to the kneecaps of complacency. Walk funny afterward

---

**LAST LINE TO THE PUBLIC**
Now that we’ve seen ourselves in the rot – _how violently will we scrub?_

**LAST LINE TO MY FAMILY**
Hopefully now you’ll better understand why I can’t stop picking at the wound

# Quick Take
I want my art to be about confronting those things we all agree to ignore. I do not want to highlight that which we cannot change, but the things we _choose to not change_. We must look, and see our reflections in the self-serving sludge we all swim in. Acknowledge how easy it is to be a villain in someone else's story

# One Liner
I want to tell the story of the 3pm meeting where we all agree not to mention the noose in the breakroom
