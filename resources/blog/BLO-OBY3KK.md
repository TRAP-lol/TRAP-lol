# My Personal Public Void
I used to stitch both halves of myself together.
I did this for the benefit of others, possibly the benefit of protecting myself

Turns out though, people prefer mannequins to patchwork monsters. 
So, now I will play their game, with one face brightly lit, and the other buried in the shadows.
I'll let them think they see me, I'll let them think they care

The alleged "me" I have hidden in the dark for so long, has grown feral.
Now a creature of cringe and self-loathing. One that gnaws at its own bones for warmth.
This feeling of worthlessness has a familiar scent, with a bed of spikes in the dark I can call my own

I hate this incessant need to hate myself. Others seem to polish away their pain.
Once they have seen the raw inside of you, you have the options to either perform recovery, or become a ghost.
You dont get told that healing has an expiration date, that sympathy expires.

My words have proven inneficient, and have failed me, failed to express to others that noise within my mind. 
So, now I wish to turn to art, to carve my own hieroglyphs into bedroom walls. 
"I WAS HERE. IT HURT. I DONT KNOW WHY"

I asked AI to roast me, and it was right.
"This reads like a late-night existential crisis dumped onto the internet"
What alternatives do I have though, A private journal? 
One I can stow away with all the other unseen, unspoken and unshared parts of myself,
to be torn and destroyed later on when I feel ashamed of who I am again?
No, I need something more permanent

Let me feel the brutality of the internet dissecting my individuality. 
For long I have thought that no one could be harder on me than myself, but I know that to be untrue. 
Now I let the internet into my mind, so they can either help me fight my demons, or strengthen them

### To any stranger who made it this far
I dont know what I am asking for, nor do I exactly know what my intentions are.
Here I simply map the different sides of myself, allowing them both a platform for communication. 
I dont want to heal, I just want to prove it bleeds.

"Hopefully at the end you’ll better understand why I can’t stop picking at the wound"
